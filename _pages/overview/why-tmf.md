## Why use the TMF?

Agencies have a number of reasons to consider the TMF as the funding source for their proposed solution:

-	**Strong Incentives.** The TMF reimagines how IT modernization projects are funded and executed. The five year repayment window provides agencies with flexibility to invest in new IT modernization projects and leverages savings generated to repay the fund.

-	**The Technology Modernization Board.** The interdisciplinary executive-level Board ensures projects are rigorously evaluated, best positioned for success, and take advantage of common solutions across the Federal Government.

-	**Technical Expertise.** Approved projects can leverage technical experts in design, engineering, acquisition, and cybersecurity to enhance project teams.

-	**Incremental Funding.** Iterative funding, tied to delivery of milestones, enables more agile and dynamic IT modernization funding and ensures taxpayers dollars are maximized.
